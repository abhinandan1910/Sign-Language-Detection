## Introduction
Sign language is a vital means of communication for many individuals. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect and interpret sign language gestures, making communication more accessible. The system utilizes a combination of image processing, hand tracking, and deep learning techniques.

## Features
- **Real-time hand tracking** using Mediapipe.
- **Image preprocessing** with OpenCV to enhance the quality of input images.
- **Deep learning model** built with TensorFlow to classify sign language gestures.
- **Scalable** to recognize a wide range of sign language gestures.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Mediapipe

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git
    cd sign-language-detection
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Use the provided scripts to collect images of hand gestures. The images will be used to train the model.
2. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to prepare the collected data for training.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. **Hand Tracking**: Use Mediapipe to track hand landmarks in real-time.
    ```bash
    python hand_tracking.py
    ```
4. **Model Training**: Train the TensorFlow model using the preprocessed data.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
5. **Inference**: Use the trained model to recognize gestures in real-time.
    ```bash
    python inference.py
    ```

## Model Training
The model is trained on a dataset of images representing different sign language gestures. The training script uses TensorFlow and can be customized to include more gestures by modifying the dataset.

### Training Parameters
- **Batch Size**: Can be configured in `train.py`.
- **Epochs**: Set the number of epochs for training.
- **Learning Rate**: Adjustable in the training script.
